  # the values below are unique to your AWS account / IoT thing and you need
  # to update them accordingly. The ssl_cert and ssl_key must be downloaded from
  # AWS IoT and stored in the fs/ directory to be included within the build:
  - ["mqtt.ssl_cert", "67e48f5611-certificate.pem.crt"]
  - ["mqtt.ssl_key", "67e48f5611-private.pem.key"]
  - ["mqtt.server", "a2mvse6841elo7-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883"]      
  - ["aws.thing_name", "alexa-smart-home-demo-SmartHomeThing-1LW418RIHGL2X"]
  
  # Number of seconds without connectivity before AWS IoT determines device has
  # disconnected; this has a direct impact on how long it takes for the LWT to
  # trigger:
  - ["mqtt.keep_alive", 5]

  # Mongoose OS comes with a default ca.pem root CA that will work for AWS.
  - ["mqtt.ssl_ca_cert", "ca.pem"] 

  # If you want to configure WiFi over Bluetooth, you need this enabled: 
  - ["bt.enable", true]

  # If you want to keep Bluetooth on instead of it auto-disabling after WiFi,
  # set keep_enabled to true. Note, this is not secure as no auth is enforced:
  - ["bt.keep_enabled", true]

  # Enable WiFi
  - ["wifi.ap.enable", false]
  - ["wifi.sta.enable", true]

  # Configure WiFi below, or easily do it wirelessly over Bluetooth from your laptop at:
  # https://mongoose-os.com/ble/#/
  # - ["wifi.sta.ssid", "YOUR WIFI NAME"]
  # - ["wifi.sta.pass", "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"]

  # Hide debugging info. If you want to see more, set this to 3 or remove from build
  - ["debug.level", 1]
